# ESP32S3-lanyard-camera [WIP]
 ESP32S3 XIAO Sense lanyard image classification demo.
 
 This demo uses the ESP32 Xiao Sense board with a camera, combined with the XIAO round screen and a 3D printed case and battery. The outcome is a live feed image classification device, the example model detects the EI logo but the model can be replaced with any EI image classification model. With a little modification it should work for object detection.
